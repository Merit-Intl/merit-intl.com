**Product Descriptions:**
Strike Fighter Squadron "ONE ONE FIVE", better known as the US Navy "Eagles," is among the units that has flown in numerous combat missions since the second Persian Gulf region conflict. This special edition of the Witty VFA-115 CAG bird replicates the great look of the "100 Years of Naval Aviation" edition of the already finely-detailed Super Hornets.

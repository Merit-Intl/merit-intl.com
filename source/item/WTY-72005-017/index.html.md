**Product Descriptions:**
Originally formed during WWII, the squadron was reformed as an aggressor group in 2005 and stationed at Nails AFB. The squadron acts as the "aggressor" opposing force to sharpen the aerial combat skills for USAF pilots. The Witty Wings scale model replicates one of the F-15Cs in use featuring the same unique desert camouflage pattern used by the unit.
